# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project is part of my #CodeAlpha_Project and focuses on performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using a fashion product dataset. The objective is to derive insights, detect anomalies, and prepare the data for future machine learning models or business strategies.
